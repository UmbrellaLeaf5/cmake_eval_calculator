## Description

In this project, in order to somehow pass the summer days, I decide to write a fully functioning expression calculator in CMake (without using any programming languages). The basis will be taken from the book by Bjarne Stroustrup "Programming. Principles and Practice Using C++", described in the chapters on grammar.

## Idea story

The idea of ​​writing this “miracle” came to me after watching another programming video that talked about building systems. The fact is that it was then that I learned that some building systems are Turing complete. Around the same time, my groupmates and I were joking about how long it took us to pass the assignment on Stroustrup’s book on C++. And so, at that very moment I joked: “Imagine if we were told to write it without C++! And this is possible! CMake is Turing-complete!”. And that same day I thought about actually doing this. However, I only got around to it summer 2024 :)
